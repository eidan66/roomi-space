# Enhanced Room Drawing System

## Overview

The enhanced room drawing system provides a comprehensive solution for creating multiple rooms with advanced features:

- **Manual Room Closing**: Rooms only close when clicking the first point
- **Multiple Rooms**: Create unlimited rooms, including nested rooms
- **Dynamic Wall Thickness**: Inside walls (10cm) vs outside walls (25cm)
- **Enhanced Floor Rendering**: Supports complex shapes and nested rooms
- **Real-time Updates**: Consistent geometry updates during and after creation

## Key Features

### 1. Manual Room Closing
- Rooms are only closed when the user manually connects the last point to the **first point**
- No automatic closing when clicking random points
- Visual feedback shows the first point as a pulsing red circle
- Status messages guide the user through the process

### 2. Multiple Room Creation
- After completing one room, immediately start drawing a new one
- Support for nested rooms (rooms inside other rooms)
- Each room maintains its own wall list and properties
- Automatic parent-child relationship detection

### 3. Dynamic Wall Thickness
- **Outside walls**: 25cm thick (walls on room perimeter)
- **Inside walls**: 10cm thick (walls inside other rooms)
- Automatic detection and recalculation when rooms are completed
- Visual thickness indicators show wall dimensions

### 4. Enhanced Floor Rendering
- Advanced triangulation algorithms for complex shapes
- Support for rooms with holes (nested rooms)
- Proper handling of irregular room shapes
- UV mapping for material textures
- Optimized geometry for better performance

## Usage Guide

### Getting Started

1. **Import the Enhanced Components**:
```tsx
import EnhancedFloorplan2DCanvas from '@/components/EnhancedFloorplan2DCanvas';
import EnhancedThreeCanvas from '@/components/EnhancedThreeCanvas';
```

2. **Set up Redux Store**: The system uses Redux for state management
```tsx
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { startNewRoom, addDrawingPoint, completeCurrentRoom } from '@/features/roomSlice';
```

### Drawing Workflow

#### Creating Your First Room

1. **Enter Draw Mode**: Click the "Draw" button or call `dispatch(startNewRoom())`
2. **Add Points**: Click anywhere on the canvas to add wall points
3. **Visual Feedback**: 
   - First point appears as a pulsing red circle
   - Subsequent points appear as blue circles
   - Preview lines show the next wall segment
4. **Close Room**: Click on the first (red) point to complete the room
5. **Auto-thickness**: Walls automatically get 25cm thickness (outside walls)

#### Creating Additional Rooms

1. **Start New Room**: After completing a room, click "New Room" or use Ctrl+N
2. **Draw Anywhere**: Create rooms adjacent to or inside existing rooms
3. **Nested Rooms**: Draw rooms inside existing rooms for complex layouts
4. **Auto-detection**: System automatically detects nested relationships

#### Advanced Features

**Grid Snapping**:
```tsx
// Enable/disable grid snapping
dispatch(toggleSnapToGrid());
```

**Wall Properties**:
```tsx
// Adjust wall height
dispatch(setWallHeight(3.0)); // 3 meters

// Set default thickness
dispatch(setDefaultWallThickness(0.20)); // 20cm
```

**Room Management**:
```tsx
// Delete a specific room
dispatch(deleteRoom(roomId));

// Clear all rooms
dispatch(clearAllRooms());

// Update room name
dispatch(updateRoomName({ roomId, name: 'Living Room' }));
```

## Technical Implementation

### Core Classes

#### `AdvancedRoomDrawing`
Main logic for room creation and management:
- Point proximity detection
- Room completion logic
- Wall thickness calculation
- Nested room detection

#### `EnhancedFloorRenderer`
Advanced floor rendering with multiple algorithms:
- Ear clipping triangulation
- Constrained Delaunay triangulation
- Hole handling for nested rooms
- UV coordinate generation

#### `RoomState` (Redux)
Comprehensive state management:
- Multiple room storage
- Drawing state tracking
- Legacy compatibility
- Real-time updates

### Data Structures

```typescript
interface DrawingRoom {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  walls: Wall[];
  isCompleted: boolean;
  parentRoomId?: string; // For nested rooms
  isActive: boolean; // Currently being drawn
}

interface RoomDrawingState {
  rooms: DrawingRoom[];
  activeRoomId: string | null;
  drawingPoints: Point[];
  isDrawing: boolean;
}
```

### Wall Thickness Logic

```typescript
// Inside walls: 10cm (walls inside other rooms)
static readonly INSIDE_WALL_THICKNESS = 0.1;

// Outside walls: 25cm (perimeter walls)
static readonly OUTSIDE_WALL_THICKNESS = 0.25;

// Automatic detection based on wall midpoint location
const isInsideAnotherRoom = rooms.some(otherRoom => 
  otherRoom.id !== room.id && 
  otherRoom.isCompleted && 
  this.isPointInsideRoom(wallMidpoint, otherRoom)
);
```

### Floor Rendering Optimization

The enhanced floor renderer uses multiple strategies:

1. **Simple Rooms**: Fast ear clipping algorithm
2. **Complex Shapes**: Advanced constrained triangulation
3. **Nested Rooms**: Hole-aware triangulation
4. **Performance**: Geometry optimization and caching

## Controls

### Mouse Controls
- **Left Click**: Add drawing point
- **Left Click (First Point)**: Close room
- **Middle/Right Drag**: Pan view
- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in/out

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Escape**: Cancel current room
- **Enter**: Complete current room (if â‰¥3 points)
- **Ctrl+N**: Start new room
- **Ctrl+S**: Save design

### Visual Indicators
- **Red Pulsing Circle**: First point (click to close room)
- **Blue Circles**: Subsequent points
- **Dashed Lines**: Preview walls
- **Green Circle**: Snap indicator
- **Thickness Labels**: Wall thickness in centimeters

## Best Practices

### Room Design
1. **Start with outer perimeter**: Create the main room boundary first
2. **Add nested rooms**: Draw interior rooms for detailed layouts
3. **Use grid snapping**: Enable for precise measurements
4. **Check wall thickness**: Verify inside/outside wall detection

### Performance
1. **Limit complexity**: Very complex rooms may impact performance
2. **Use optimization**: Enable geometry optimization for better rendering
3. **Progressive creation**: Build rooms incrementally rather than all at once

### Error Handling
1. **Minimum walls**: Rooms need at least 3 walls
2. **Wall length**: Minimum 10cm wall length enforced
3. **Closure validation**: Ensures proper room geometry

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Room won't close**:
- Make sure you're clicking the first (red) point
- Check minimum 3 walls requirement
- Verify points aren't too close together

**Floor not rendering**:
- Check room is properly closed
- Verify wall connections
- Complex shapes may need geometry optimization

**Wall thickness incorrect**:
- Thickness recalculates after room completion
- Nested detection runs automatically
- Manual refresh may be needed for complex layouts

**Performance issues**:
- Reduce room complexity
- Enable geometry optimization
- Consider splitting complex designs

### Debug Information

The system provides comprehensive debugging:
- Room validation status
- Wall count and connections
- Geometry health checks
- Performance metrics

## Migration from Legacy System

The enhanced system maintains compatibility with existing code:

```tsx
// Legacy approach still works
const { walls, setWalls } = useAdvancedRoom([]);

// Enhanced approach recommended
const { rooms, walls } = useSelector(state => state.room);
const dispatch = useDispatch();
```

Key differences:
- Multiple rooms vs single room
- Redux state vs local state
- Enhanced geometry vs basic rendering
- Manual closing vs auto-closing

## Examples

### Basic Room Creation
```tsx
function RoomDrawingExample() {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const { isDrawing, drawingPoints } = useSelector(state => state.room);

  const startDrawing = () => {
    dispatch(startNewRoom());
    dispatch(setEditMode('draw'));
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={startDrawing}>Start New Room</button>
      <EnhancedFloorplan2DCanvas />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Multiple Room Management
```tsx
function MultiRoomManager() {
  const { rooms } = useSelector(state => state.room);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return (
    <div>
      {rooms.map(room => (
        <div key={room.id}>
          <span>{room.name} ({room.walls.length} walls)</span>
          <button onClick={() => dispatch(deleteRoom(room.id))}>
            Delete
          </button>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

This enhanced system provides a professional-grade room drawing experience with advanced features and robust error handling, perfect for complex architectural planning and interior design applications.
